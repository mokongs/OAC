				<p>When you have the basic foundations for your business all laid out, it's time to launch it.</p>

				<h5>How to launch a business</h5>

				<p>With the recent economic climate, it's understandable why a lot of entrepreneurs are a little hesitant to kickstart their business. But plenty of success stories such as Apple, Microsoft, and General Electric were all launched during difficult times. These stories just show that if you want it bad enough, you can work your way through any economic climate.</p>

				<p>Are you ready to launch your business? Here are some tips on how to launch your startup right:</p>

				<ol> 
					<li><strong>Get Started</strong>
						<p>It sounds simple, but many entrepreneurs find it hard to actually get the business up and running. Many good business plans are wasted because people wait for the perfect time to launch it, when the right time can actually be hard to come by. By postponing your launch, you may end up not launching at all. Avoid this by setting timelines and deadlines. Try going for a month to the actual launch date and in that period, work on the things you need to make the launch happen.</p>
					</li><br/>
					<li><strong>Get the Word Out</strong>
						<p>Time to tell the world about your business! Don't worry if you don't think everything is ready; this will help you be more accountable and really stick to your launch schedule. The great thing about technology nowadays is that you don't have to spend a lot to start marketing your business. Put up a website and set up social media accounts for your startup. Not only do you get word out, you can also get essential feedback from people.</p>
					</li><br/>
					<li><strong>Discuss Launch Stages with Your Team</strong>
						<p>Break down the project into stages and discuss each step with your team. This way, everyone will have a clear idea of what's going to happen and who will be responsible for what. Make sure that you also determine who has the final call on each process to avoid bottlenecks in the execution.</p>
					</li><br/>
					<li><strong>Prepare for Launch Hiccups</strong>
						<p>Taking step 3 a bit further, try to identify potential obstacles and the steps you'll have to take to deal with them. You don't have to set up a plan for every hiccup; just make contingency plans of what you'll do in case Plan A doesn't work out.</p>
					</li><br/>
					<li><strong>Delegate Accordingly</strong>
						<p>Identify the different areas of your startup like customer service, creatives, advertising, and so on. Assign a person responsible for each area. This way you'll be able to communicate to your team more efficiently.</p>
					</li><br/>
					<li><strong>Improve Continuously</strong>
						<p>By this time, you'd have gotten feedback from your team and your growing online fan-base. Take time to identify things that you can still improve on. This exercise helps you be more proactive in terms of managing your business launch.</p>
					</li>
